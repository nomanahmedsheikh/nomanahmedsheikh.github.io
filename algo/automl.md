# Auto ML: Literature Review 
The sole objective of this venture is to be able to create a framework that lets non ML users train decent models directly from dataframe or excel.


### Some out of the box tools
These are some of the tools that are worth trying out before you do anything:
1. Rasa NLU
2. Ludwig
3. H<sub>2</sub>O Auto ML

### Background
Its good to know these topics if you are trying to approach this problem in the traditional RL way:
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
  - Transition Matrices
  - Concept of rewards
  - What does it mean to solve an MDP? <br><sub>_It means that we need to find a policy dictating what actions to take in a particular state such that the overall reward id maximized_</sub>
- Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)
  - You don't know your current state
  - Belief Space
- Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
