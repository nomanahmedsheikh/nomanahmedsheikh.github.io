# Auto ML: Literature Review 
The sole objective of this venture is to be able to create a framework that lets non ML users train decent models directly from dataframe or excel.


### Some out of the box tools
These are some of the tools that are worth trying out before you do anything:
1. Rasa NLU
2. Ludwig
3. H<sub>2</sub>O Auto ML

### Background
Its good to know these topics if you are trying to approach this problem in the traditional RL way:
- Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs)

### Publications

- Neural Architecture Search: A Survey [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.05377.pdf)
