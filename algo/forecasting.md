# Forecasting

The predictability of an event or a quantity depends on several factors including:
1. how well we understand the factors that contribute to it;
2. how much data are available;
3. whether the forecasts can affect the thing we are trying to forecast.

Forecasts rarely assume that the environment is unchanging. What is normally assumed is that the way in which the environment is changing will continue into the future.


##### What is a time series?
Anything that is observed sequentially over time is a time series. In this book, we will only consider time series that are observed at regular intervals of time (e.g., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually). Irregularly spaced time series can also occur, but are beyond the scope of this book.
